# Connect 4 Detection

This project implements computer vision detection for Connect 4 game boards using deep learning. It's designed as the vision component for a robotic arm system that can play Connect 4 against humans.

## Project Overview

This detection system is part of a larger robotic Connect 4 player project. The full robot arm implementation can be found here: [NED Robot Arm Project](https://github.com/SamS709/ned_project)

## Training Process

### 1. Data Collection
Approximately **700 pictures** of Connect 4 game boards were captured in various game states and lighting conditions to create a diverse training dataset.

### 2. Image Preprocessing
The `rename.py` script normalizes all image filenames to ensure consistent naming conventions across the dataset.

### 3. Labeling
The `automatic_label.py` tool provides a user-friendly GUI for annotating the Connect 4 board states in each image:

This interface allows quick and accurate labeling of each cell in the 6x7 Connect 4 grid, marking empty spaces, red pieces, and yellow pieces.

### 4. Model Training
A **Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)** is trained to detect and classify each position on the Connect 4 board. The model learns to:
- Identify the board grid structure
- Classify each cell as empty, red piece, or yellow piece
- Handle various lighting conditions and viewing angles

### Training Results

The plot shows the model's learning progress across training epochs, demonstrating convergence of both training and validation metrics.

## Purpose

This detection system enables a robotic arm to:
1. Visually perceive the current game state
2. Identify valid moves
3. Plan and execute strategic gameplay against human opponents
